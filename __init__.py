print ("my first python package",'''Question:

Importing modules and putting the module name in front is such a bother, why do I need to do this?

        Answer:
It keeps everything modular and separate. For instance many modules have a read() function since this is a common thing to do. Without using the <module>.<function>(...) syntax there would be no way to know which one to call.
